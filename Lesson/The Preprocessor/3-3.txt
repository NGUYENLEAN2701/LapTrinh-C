Preprocessor Operators


The C preprocessor provides the following operators.

The # Operator

The # macro operator is called the stringification or stringizing operator and tells the preprocessor to convert a parameter to a string constant.
White space on either side of the argument are ignored and escape sequences are recognized.

For example:
#include <stdio.h>

#define TO_STR(x) #x

int main() {
  
  printf("%s\n", TO_STR( 123\\12 ));
  
  return 0;
}

The ## Operator


The ## operator is also called the token pasting operator because it appends, or "pastes", tokens together.

For example:

#include <stdio.h>

#define VAR(name, num) name##num

int main() {
  int x1 = 125;
  int x2 = 250;
  int x3 = 500;
  
  printf("%d\n", VAR(x, 3));
  
  return 0;
}
