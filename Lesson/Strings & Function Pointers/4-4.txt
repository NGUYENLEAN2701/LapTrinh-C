The void Pointer

A void pointer is used to refer to any address type in memory and has a declaration that looks like:
void *ptr;

The following program uses the same pointer for three different data types:

int x = 33;
float y = 12.4;
char c = 'a';
void *ptr;
  
ptr = &x;
printf("void ptr points to %d\n", *((int *)ptr));
ptr = &y;
printf("void ptr points to %f\n", *((float *)ptr));
ptr = &c;
printf("void ptr points to %c", *((char *)ptr));


When dereferencing a void pointer, you must first type cast the pointer to the appropriate data type before dereferencing with *.
